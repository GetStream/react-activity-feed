### Breaking changes

Components related to uploading files have been moved to the separate
[`react-file-utils`](https://github.com/GetStream/react-file-utils) library.
These components are not exported anymore from this library for clarity and
consistency. Following is the list of components that have been moved to
`react-file-utils`:

- `FileIcon`
- `FilePreviewer`
- `FileUploadButton`
- `IconButton`
- `ImageDropzone`
- `ImagePreviewer`
- `ImageUploadButton`
- `LoadingIndicator`
- `Thumbnail`
- `ThumbnailPlaceholder`

What you need to change:

- If you imported any of these components directly from `react-activity-feed`
  you should now import them from `react-file-utils`.
- If you've overridden the styles for these components you will need to modify
  it to change the class prefix from `raf-` to `rfu-`.
