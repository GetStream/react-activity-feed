# Feed

The `Feed` component is a React Context provider which is responsible for creating (or pulling one from `sharedFeeds`) `FeedManager` instance and providing its methods and data. This component is by default used by `FlatFeed` and `NotificationFeed` controller* components.

## Basic usage

```tsx
<StreamApp apiKey={apiKey} appId={appId} token={token}>
	<Feed feedGroup="user">
		<MyCustomComponent />
	</Feed>
</StreamApp>
```

Any child of this component can utilise `useFeedContext` hook to access `FeedManager` methods and data.

```ts
const {
	feedGroup,
	userId,
	feedManager, // FeedManager instance
	getActivityPath, 
	onToggleReaction,
	onAddReaction,
	onRemoveReaction,
	onToggleChildReaction,
	onAddChildReaction,
	onRemoveChildReaction,
	onRemoveActivity,
	onMarkAsRead,
	onMarkAsSeen,
	refresh,
	refreshUnreadUnseen,
	loadNextReactions,
	loadNextPage,
	hasNextPage,
	loadReverseNextPage,
	hasReverseNextPage,
	activityOrder,
	activities, // array of activities
	realtimeAdds,
	realtimeDeletes,
	refreshing,
	unread, // unread count
	unseen, // unseen count
	hasDoneRequest
} = useFeedContext();
```
