# StreamApp

The `StreamApp` component is a React Context provider that wraps the entire Activity Feed application. It provides the `StreamContext` to its children, which includes the StreamClient (`client`) instance. All other components within the library which need to be able to access `client` must be nested as children of `StreamApp` to maintain proper functionality.

## Basic usage

```tsx
<StreamApp apiKey={apiKey} appId={appId} token={token}>
	<StatusUpdateForm feedGroup="user" />
	<FlatFeed feedGroup="user">
</StreamApp>
```

Any child of the `StreamApp` component has access to the `StreamContext`. Each React Context in the component library can be accessed with one of our custom hooks, which must be imported individually.

```ts
import { useStreamContext } from 'react-activity-feed'; // available since version 1.0.0

const { client } = useStreamContext();
```

Older versions of this SDK may be missing this custom hook but the context itself is still exported and can be used with `React.useContext`.

```ts
import { StreamContext } from 'react-activity-feed';

// somewhere in your component
const { client } = React.useContext(StreamContext);
```
